# Hand_Cricket
Welcome to python based Hand Cricket!
Hand Cricket is a game based on the sport cricket but entirely played using hands. This game is quite popular in South India. In-order to play this game, the rules are as follows.
The game is played as user v/s PC. 
The user must make a toss between odd or even. 
Then user must play a toss by entering a number ranging from 1 to 6. 
The PC also makes a toss. The toss of the PC and the user is added and odd/even is checked. 
If user's choice is odd and the toss is odd, user gets the option to bat/ball.
When user's choice is batting, user must hit numbers ranging from 1-6 and if the PC's number is different from the user's number, it results in user's number being added to score.
Once both the user's number and PC's number are equal, it results in Wicket where the score of user is stored.
This results in PC to bat and the same process continues.
The game is finished when PC scores higher than the user, resulting PC to win whereas User wins when he takes the wicket before the PC outscores the user.
